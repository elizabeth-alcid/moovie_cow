'Moovie Cow' is a Python script that when ran, prompts the user for a movie title. Once the user types in their movie and hits the 'GO' button, the script will open a new window 
in the web browser and open the movie on whichever streaming service it's available on. The main script's functionality relies on the Watchmode API (https://api.watchmode.com/)
to determine what streaming services the movie is available on. If the movie is not available on any streaming platform, it will default to opening the movie on 123movies
